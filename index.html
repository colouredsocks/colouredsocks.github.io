    <h2>I love socks!</h2>

    <p>Even as a child I could never choose a favorite colour, I'm too greedy I really do love all of them at once and I im fasinated about how we can use colour to communicate. Its use in art, design, fashion.your interests, anything that springs to mind to share with everyone. Remember that information you write about yourself and is published on the world wide web (www) is readable by anyone in any part of the globe, as long as there's an internet connection.
    </p>

    <p>I chose to talk about socks because its a little out there, you know weird and its really a little habit I have is socks watching, if that can be a real thing. Started when I worked in a shoe store as a sales assistant. simply write about yourself as a way of introducing yourself to everyone in DMD&D module! and temporarlily forget about the www.

    <p>Later on, in your own time, you'll be able to publish this first webpage online, and if there's something you want to edit out then do so before publishing.
